# FASTLANE

We have all wasted time in traffic -- seeing some lanes move faster while we are stuck in slower-moving lanes.  As it turnes out, there are trends that can be observed for traffic patterns in a busy highway. For example, a lane that exists to a not-so busy street lets cars in that lane to go faster than other lanes in the highway. Only if you knew that somehow and could get on that lane ASAP!! -- Of course you need to maneuver back to the main road before the lane exits :) Likewise, an exit to an even busier highway causes the traffic to spill over to the main road. Therefore, lanes farther away from the exit tend to go faster.

FastLane is an app that allows you to record these trends as you pass through traffic so you can choose your lanes wisely the next time around.  Use the Google Sign-in button below to keep your profile stored in the cloud -- you can conveniently access it from any device.
